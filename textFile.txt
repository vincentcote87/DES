Welcome to the School of Graduate Studies!
The University of Lethbridge is a comprehensive academic and research institute, which offers graduate programs, at the Master and Doctoral levels,
spanning over 60 disciplines. Additional graduate programs will be introduced, to meet the demands of Faculty researchers and students, 
in alignment with the strategic priorities of the University of Lethbridge.

Graduate work at the University of Lethbridge started in 1982 with the introduction of the MEd degree program in the Faculty of Education. 
In 1991, thesis based MA and MSc programs were introduced. With the approval of the MSc in Management program in June of 2000 and the implementation of the doctoral program
in limited academic areas, consolidation of all post-baccalaureate programs under the School of Graduate Studies was proposed and approved by the General Faculties Council
(GFC) in April 2000. At its 17 May 2000 meeting, the Board of Governors established the School of Graduate Studies.
